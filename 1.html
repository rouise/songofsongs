<h2>Adele - make you feel my love</h2>
<strong><a href="https://youtu.be/0put0_a--Ng" target="_blank"
  title="adele make you feel my love">make you feel my
  <u>love</u></a> </strong>
  <p>When the rain is blowing in your face
  And the whole world is on your case
  I could offer you a warm embrace
  To make you feel my love</p>
  <p>When the evening shadows and the stars appear
  And there is no one there to dry your tears
  I could hold you for a million years
  To make you feel my love
  I know you haven`t made your mind up yet
  But I will never do you wrong</p
  style="margin-top:"40px;"">
  <p>No doubt in my mind where you belong
  I`d go hungry, I`d go black and blue
  And I`d go crawling down the avenue
  No there`s nothing that I wouldn`t do
  To make you feel my love</p>
  <p>The storms are raging on the rolling sea
  And on the highway of regret
  The winds of change are blowing wild and free
  You ain`t seen nothing like me, yet
  I could make you happy,
  make your dreams come true
  Nothing that I wouldn`t do
  Go to the ends of the earth for you</p>
  <p>To make you feel my love
  To make you feel my love</p>
